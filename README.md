# Project Description

This project aims to showcase my background skills in responsive design using the Bootstrap component framework.

The project is a one-page design created for advertising coding skills. It consists of one container named 'container-fluid,' within which two grid system containers are nested.

The first grid container (row) contains only one column spanning 12 columns from small mobile devices up to extra-extra-large (col-sm-12). This column focuses on user experience and user interface elements, serving as the starting point for the advertisement.

The second grid container (row) encompasses two columns, each spanning 6 columns from medium devices up to extra-extra-large. Consequently, they will span 12 columns each on small mobiles.

The font family used was 'Karla,' sans-serif, and the font sizes used across the project were 14px, 15px, and 16px, respectively. The font weights used were 400, 500, and 700. Despite encountering some attributes not documented in Bootstrap, I managed to use custom CSS to customize them. These attributes include font family, sizes, weights, background colors, and text colors.
